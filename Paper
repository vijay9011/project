Aim

To develop a web-based platform that bridges the gap between farmers and brokers, enabling farmers to upload their products, compare price offers from brokers, and select the best deal, thereby ensuring transparency, fair pricing, and enhanced market access.

 

Theory

Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, yet farmers often face challenges such as low pricing, lack of market access, and dependence on intermediaries. Traditional marketing systems involve multiple middlemen, which leads to inefficiencies and price exploitation. Digital platforms have emerged as a solution to these issues, providing farmers with direct access to markets and tools for better price discovery.

The Farmer-Broker web app leverages modern web technologies to create an intuitive platform where farmers can upload product details and photos. Brokers, in turn, can place bids or offer prices for the listed products. The app facilitates transparency in transactions, allows for competitive pricing, and provides a streamlined interface to manage product listings and offers.

This project integrates core concepts of web development, database management, and user experience design to deliver a robust and user-friendly solution.
